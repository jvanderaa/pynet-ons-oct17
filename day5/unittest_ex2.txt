Create a unit test file named test_ex2.py.

In this unit test create a unit test fixture that establishes an SSH
connection to pynet-rtr2.

Write a unit test that uses this SSH fixture and executes the 'show ip
int brief' command on the remote device. The unit test should pass if
the output contains the IP address '10.220.88.21'. Otherwise, the unit
test should fail.
